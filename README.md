## Alfred-bmlite

Simple sqlite workflow to search a sqlite database for bookmarks.

- `bmq`: Searches "quickmarks", links that are often used
- `bm`: Searches all bookmarks, including those in a reading list

### TODO

- [ ] Include import script from Instapaper, Pinboard and browser
- [ ] Allow adding URL from browser
- [ ] Add DB path to workflow variables (currently set in `config.py`)
